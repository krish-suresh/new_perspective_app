# New Perspective App for Google Solutions Challenge
This is the repository for the 2021 Google Solutions Challenge. The premise of our teamâ€™s project was to develop a platform for individuals from differing perspectives to share their worldview in a one to one discussion. With each time limited discussion users are prompted to answer an inconclusive question in a civil manner. Users are matched via their profile which aims to connect people from categorically different backgrounds. After a conversation users score the other user on how much insight they gained. 

This application was developed on the flutter framework and hosted via firebase. Below are some of the app designs:
